<h2 id="page-1">Page 1</h2>
<p>This page is designed to take in as much or as little client data as you have available. Whether it&#39;s just on the phone taking an initial enquiry, or you want to generate a full event sheet and invoice for a job that&#39;s been booked in since last year.</p>
<p>All the fields are optional, you could just leave them all blank and it would still work. probably best not to though.</p>
<h3 id="a-description-of-each-field-and-what-it-does">A Description of each field, and what it does:</h3>
<p>All fields are optional and have very little error checking (you can pretty much put whatever you want in and it&#39;ll either work or not...)
